This Repo contains pi-hole block lists for most, if not all of the microsoft servers that an xbox 360 will connect to when connected to the internet.

This is useful if you have a RGH/JTAG xbox 360 that you don't want to go online at all, or if you're using Badavatar/Badupdate and want to keep challenge checks from banning your console before your Stealth server kicks in. It will still allow your console to download title updates and Cover PNGs from XboxUnity.

Use XboxLive_blocklist for basic coverage.

Add Xbguard_alt_servers for a complete block of xbox live, even when using Stealth servers.

Add the Xbl_Content_servers list to block downloads, catalog and avatar domains (probably not necessary).

Complete_Xbl_block list is a list that combines all 3 of these in one place for easily toggling on and off.
